# Hi there, I'm Mikk 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me
I'm a self-taught programmer, writing my first block of Python with the help of my dad at 8 years old. My GitHub activity might be a bit sparse, that's because I primarily do most of my work on Bitbucket. So, if things seem quiet around here, it's not for a lack of coding – it's just happening elsewhere! 😅

## WakaTime Stats
Here's a breakdown of the languages I've been using over the past week:
